# AppointmentApp

It's a demo project for training purpose, to show the usage of:

- Components with properties, methods, imports
- Modules (to start, just one module)
- One way binding with string interpolation: {{propertyName}}
- Two way binding with: [(ngModel)]="propertyName"
- Event, like: (click)
- Angular Lifecycle hooks, like: ngOnInit(), with the OnInit interface implementation (used to load data from the local storage)
- Implementation of the browser local storage

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.6, and **is not standalone**.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
